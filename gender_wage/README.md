Gender wage gap study
-	Does the gender wage gap exist or is comprised of other variables?
o	Age, education, race, work experience, productivity (ex: value provided?)
o	Maybe: segmented bar graph or pie chart showing each variable part of the just wage/gender reg
-	What are the jobs with the highest gender disparity?
o	Why? What do these jobs entail

-	What other variables can we test
o	Does height/weight/appearance affect wage

-	We are paid on value provided
o	How valuable are you?
	Skills/how many people can provide the same service as you
o	What determines value provided?
	Some things quantifiable like sales, numbers, production
	Other things not so easily like leadership, likability, (ex: makes everyone’s jobs easier/more efficient/productive)
